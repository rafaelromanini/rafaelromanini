<h3>About Me</h3>

I’m an 19-year-old software developer passionate about technology, innovation, and continuous learning. I recently joined Sociedade Brasileira Caminho de Damasco (SBCD) as a Junior Software Developer, where I work with Java, Spring, Node.js, React and DevOps practices to build and maintain scalable systems that support real-world healthcare operations.

SBCD is a nonprofit Social Health Organization (OSS) focused on delivering human-centered care and managing public health services in partnership with Brazil’s SUS. The mission emphasizes quality, operational excellence, and positive impact for the communities served.

Previously, I worked as a Full Stack Development Intern at Divulgador Inteligente, a SaaS affiliate marketing platform, developing features and maintaining products with Node.js, React.js, and Next.js. These experiences strengthened my end-to-end understanding of building, shipping, and evolving software in multidisciplinary teams.

I’m currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at FIAP, with expected graduation in December 2025, and I have advanced English (Skill Idiomas). I also completed a Technical Administration course at ETEC Jorge Street. My goal is to keep growing as a developer, learn continuously, and contribute to projects that create meaningful impact.
